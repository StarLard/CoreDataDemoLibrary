# CoreDataDemoLibrary

## Installation

CoreDataDemoLibrary is available through [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), a dependency manager built into Xcode.

If you are using Xcode 11 or higher, go to **File / Swift Packages / Add Package Dependency...** and enter package repository URL **https://github.com/StarLard/CoreDataDemoLibrary.git**, then follow the instructions.

To remove the dependency, select the project and open **Swift Packages** (which is next to **Build Settings**). You can add and remove packages from this tab.

> Swift Package Manager can also be used [from the command line](https://swift.org/package-manager/).
